Ladies and Gentlemen, we're extremely excited to present to you our first ever
"Supercars at Sunset" event, coming up on
Saturday, August 12th!
Unlike any of our past events - this show will be held at dusk, from 7:00pm to 10:00pm. The event will be held at our Cars and Coffee location, @thehoustoncafe! The Cafe will be open to the public, serving delicious dinner meals. We will have live music, plenty of stunning vehicles on display, and after dusk... FIREWORKS!
Our team here at @adk_automotive has highly anticipated this event for quite some time, and we can't wait to have you all! Stay tuned for more information on the event in the coming days. We look forward to seeing you all on the 12th!
