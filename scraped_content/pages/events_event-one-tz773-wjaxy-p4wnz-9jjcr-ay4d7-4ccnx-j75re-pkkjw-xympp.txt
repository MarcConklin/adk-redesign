The 2024 Lancaster Supercar Cruise will begin with a Pre-Rally Supercar show at the Classic Automall in Morgantown PA, from 8:00am to 10:00am. After a brief drivers meeting, our 300+ participants will be taking an incredible turnpike rally to Warminster Community Park’s abandoned airstrip, for a “Post Rally” Supercar show. Participants will be treated to music, shade, and delicious food & drinks served by Strada Cafe LLC! Lancaster Supercar Cruise is proud to benefit the Lancaster Food Hub, giving back to those in need in the Lancaster County region with the basic essentials; food, clothing, shelter and much more. We encourage all those attending to bring Non-Perishable Food Items & Donations to the event! - Registration is $40.00 a vehicle, and event proceeds go to Lancaster Food Hub.
