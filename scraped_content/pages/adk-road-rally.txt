DRIVERS BRIEFING
Our ADK Road Rallies are specifically designed to deliver an engaging and safe experience for all participants. We ensure a smooth rally by conducting detailed driver’s meetings before each event. These meetings cover crucial information about the rally route, potential hazards, safety protocols, and much more. Our goal is to make sure that everyone is well-prepared and informed, allowing for a fun and secure adventure on the road.
THE DRIVE
Our ADK Road Rallies are designed to offer a perfect balance of excitement and safety. Each rally is curated with care, as our team selects the most exhilarating and scenic driving roads. These routes are a combination of thrilling backroads, stunning views, and smooth highway stretches, ensuring a diverse and enjoyable experience for every participant. Along the way, we’ve also included multiple scenic regroup points, allowing drivers to pause, take in the surroundings, and connect with others.
To guarantee a safe and seamless journey, each rally is led by our official ‘pace vehicles,’ which are marked cars, providing guide participants throughout the route. Our event staff is present at all times, providing support, direction, and ensuring the event runs smoothly. This hands-on management allows us to create an immersive and safe rally experience, where participants can fully enjoy the adventure while having peace of mind.
ROUTE NAVIGATION
Our ADK Road Rally participants will be navigating using the “Rallista” app, which can be found on the App Store. This app will provide you thorough turn-by-turn directions for complex rally routes. While on the road, yourself and/or your Co-Pilot will be able to navigate route’s turn-by-turn directions, regroup points and ETA to make your time on the drive seamless and fun!
