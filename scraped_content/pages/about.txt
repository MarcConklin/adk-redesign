About Us
Our Mission
Since 2021, ADK Automotive LLC has been built on a foundation of giving back, driven by a deep love for the automotive industry and the incredible community it supports.
At the heart of our mission is a commitment to empower and uplift the automotive community through the love of Christ. We strive to create memorable experiences by hosting events that foster genuine connections—both personal and professional—while promoting an environment of excitement and safety.
Whether you’re attending our laid-back cars and coffee gathering, an exhilarating road rally, or a grand supercar show, we believe there’s something for everyone. Every event we organize is designed to inspire, bring people together, and celebrate the passion that fuels this vibrant community.
We welcome all who share this enthusiasm and can’t wait to see you at our next event. Together, we’ll continue to drive this community forward—united by our love for cars and the spirit of fellowship in Christ.
